##### The Program 
---

This points program lets the user create 3 points, x, y, and z, and gives them the ability to access and set the values of x y and z. Furthermore they can get the distance between the points and solve for the area of the triangle that is made using the three points. 


##### Source Files
---

Name: main.cpp
    Main driver file designed for testing the program. 
Name: area.cpp
    Computes the area of the triangle using a funciton and herons formula 
Name: Point.h
    Point class declaration
Name: Point.cpp
  Point class implementation with constructors, destructors, push and get functions, and a distance between points function. 
    
**In addition, there are some test files. 
    
##### Circumstances of Program
---

The program ran successfully and passed all the tests.
